Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that leads to the degeneration and death of brain cells, resulting in a decline in cognitive functions, memory, and behavior. It is the most common cause of dementia, affecting millions of people worldwide. Early symptoms often include difficulty remembering recent events or conversations, but as the disease progresses, individuals may experience severe memory loss, confusion, changes in personality, and difficulty with language, problem-solving, and daily activities. The disease is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, which disrupt the communication between neurons and ultimately lead to their death. Risk factors for Alzheimer's include age, genetics, and lifestyle factors such as poor diet and lack of physical activity. While there is currently no cure for Alzheimer's, treatments are available to manage symptoms and improve the quality of life for those affected. Support services and therapies can also help patients and their caregivers cope with the challenges posed by the disease.
